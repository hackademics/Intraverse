# Intraverse

OK.. this currently has nothing to do with intranets.  I'm still learning the core dynamics of Unity3D, so it's a game.

Game Play:  

Shoot Gold items twice, then pick them up.
You are being chased by Mr. Grim.  Get touched by him and lose health.
You can shoot Mr. Grim and get points, but he re-pawns with more speed.

Couple things:

Not using a Terrain object.
Importing simple Blender objects and then replicating them.
